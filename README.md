## 📋 Overview

This platform was built to **digitise and automate** manual construction project management workflows. It replaces spreadsheet-based tracking with a structured, relational system that handles:

- **Project lifecycle management** aligned with [RIBA Work Stages](https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/resources-landing-page/riba-plan-of-work)
- **Stakeholder directory** with organisation and contact management
- **Time tracking analytics** with stage-level burn rate and risk detection
- **Automated PDF/document generation** for professional reporting
- **Batch document processing** for operational efficiency

### Why This Matters

This is not a tutorial or coursework project. It mirrors a **real production system** that:
- Has **real users** (project managers, directors)
- Manages **real data** (projects, contacts, time entries)
- Has **real consequences** if it breaks
- Replaced **manual admin processes** saving hours per week

### 🛠️ Key Engineering Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Atomic Transactions** | Ensures data integrity during multi-stage project updates using SQLAlchemy sessions. |
| **Pydantic Schemas** | Strict type-safety and field validation at the API entry point to prevent SQL injection and data corruption. |
| **Service Layer Decoupling** | Document generation and analytics logic are isolated for independent scaling and easier unit testing. |
| **80% Proactive Alerting** | Implemented a 0.8 risk scalar to catch budget overruns before they reach 100%, allowing for management intervention. |
| **Relational Integrity** | Forced One-to-Many constraints between Organisations, Contacts, and Projects to maintain a "Single Source of Truth." |

## 📊 Key Engineering Decisions

### 1. Relational Data Modelling
```
Projects ──┐
            ├── Project Directory (one-to-many)
Contacts ──┘

Projects ──┐
            ├── Time Entries (one-to-many)
RIBA Stages┘
```
**Why**: Avoids data duplication. A contact exists once; their role per project is stored in the directory junction. This mirrors how enterprise databases are designed.

### 2. Idempotent Operations
All write operations check for existing records before creating new ones, preventing duplicate entries across linked datasets. This is critical for data integrity in multi-user environments.

### 3. Production-Safe Development
- **Soft deletes**: Records are marked inactive, never permanently removed
- **Dev/Prod separation**: Features validated in development before production deployment
- **Defensive filtering**: API endpoints validate parameters and handle edge cases gracefully

### 4. Risk Detection Logic
```python
# Stage-level burn rate with 80% threshold
risk_level = (hours_used / hours_allocated) * 100
if risk_level >= 80:
    flag_as_at_risk(project, stage)
```
**Why**: Catching overruns at 100% is too late. 80% threshold gives managers time to act — this is how real construction cost control works.

## 📈 Business Impact

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Document updates (50+ files) | ~3 hours manual | **< 30 seconds automated** |
| Project directory lookup | Scattered spreadsheets | **Single searchable interface** |
| Time overrun detection | End-of-project surprise | **Real-time stage-level alerts** |
| Report generation | Manual Word/Excel formatting | **One-click branded PDF export** |
